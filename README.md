## Abstract

Essentially, Pillars is based on the idea that humans are generally happiest when following a largely pattern-based 
schedule. People like to be consistent and have convictions that they desire and wish to work toward. Often times, these
convictions are chosen for them and based in obligations, but I feel that when we are able to choose them precisely and
go toward them at our own pace, we reach a better understanding of the monotony of the human experience. For this 
reason, Pillars is essentially a long-term goal chooser and tracker that shows us the progress we make in our efforts.
The name "Pillars" comes from an idea that we all have implicit pillars or staples of our day that make us feel like the
day was more fulfilling. For example, wanting to be active every day, maintaining a strict diet every day, or
abstaining from bad habits every day. This is something that I have been keeping track in my life already that I simply 
thought that an application would help smooth the process over for. This application will simply ask every day whether 
or not you have accomplished these pillars and then show you the statistics over long stretches of time how you've done.
